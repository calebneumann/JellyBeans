//this dear partner is where the THEMES are going to go
//Themes to add: light, dark, colorblind, aaaaaaannnnd...
//CUSTOM!!! Debating whether to add a custom built list of colors or 
//somehow figure out how to add an RGB slider but we'll see...
//...we shall see...

//text should be black or white depending on the brightness of the theme
  //or always make background brighter and the appbar/navbar darker
  //like a colorful sandwich

//start with presets and get those functional, then do RGB panel
  //perfecting an RGB selected theme will be hard because of what needs to 
  //change depending on if the color is bright/dark/clashes with both white and black text
